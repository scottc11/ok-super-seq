 * NOTE: "It is common in FreeRTOS designs for a task to receive data from more than one source. 
 * The receiving task needs to know where the data came from to determine how the data should be processed. 
 * An easy design solution is to use a single queue to transfer structures with both the value of the data 
 * and the source of the data contained in the structure’s fields." - Chapter 4.4 Mastering the FreeRTOS Kernel
